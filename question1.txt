Build & Inspect API Requests

   1.  Install and open Postman (or use an alternative like Hoppscotch).

   2.  Make a GET request to a public API 

(e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1).

   3 .Make a POST request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts with a JSON body:

    {

   "title": "My First API Post",

   "body": "Learning APIs is fun!",

   "userId": 101

    }

    4. In your browser DevTools Network tab, trigger a request to any website (e.g., your own site or google.com) and inspect:

        URL
        Method
        Request headers
        Response headers
        Body (if any)

    5. Write a short explanation (5–8 lines) describing what happened from request → response.
